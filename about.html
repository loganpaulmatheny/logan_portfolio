          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Logan - I am a mission oriented software engineer
            with a passion for building tools that make the lives of others
            better. I continue to gain experience as a software engineer
            currently pursuing my Masters in CS. I take pride in my ability to
            create a positive environment and work well in a team that
            accomplishes goals and have some fun along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a former Officer in the U.S. Army, I believe in empathetic and
            people first leadership that leverages the unique strengths of team
            members, and ensures everyone feels included and valued. I believe
            that by working in teams, leveraging individual strengths, and
            focusing on the elements that make us human, we can build flexible
            and resilient software that solves challenges faced by real people.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a unique blend of technical and people skills, I hope to
            continue making a broad impact at your company, my community, and
            broader society.
          </p>
